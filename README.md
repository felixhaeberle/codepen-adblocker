### Introduction
I can highly recommend getting a PRO Account on CodePen because trying quick snippets has never been easier! I created this extension because I often stumble over CodePen not logged in and then the advertising sometimes harms the experience. This repository isn't planned to get regular updates but feel free to submit pull request or issues. <br>Happy coding! ⌨️🎉
